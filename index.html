<h2>Information</h2>

<p><a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> is Ohio's third largest city and the largest metro region. It lies on the north bank of the Ohio River in 
    Southwest Ohio in the United States of America. Known as the "Queen City" or "Queen of the West," Cincinnati was the only 19th century American city that left a favorable 
    impression on the then 30-year-old English author <a href="https://libapps.libraries.uc.edu/liblog/2012/02/charles-dickens-in-cincinnati/">Charles Dickens.</a>“Cincinnati 
    is a beautiful city; cheerful, thriving, and animated,” Dickens wrote in “American Notes.” 
    “I have not often seen a place that commends itself so favorably and pleasantly to a stranger at the first glance as this does: with its clean houses of red and white, 
    its well-paved roads, and foot-ways of bright tile. Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance.”</p>
